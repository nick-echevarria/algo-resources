//////// What is Big O? ////////

// A system used to compare code, a vocabulary to describe how code performs and the trade-offs involved, a tool used 
// to help debug code, a "way to formalize fuzzy counting", allow us to talk about how the runtime of an algorithm grows
// as the inputs grow.

// Instead of using time, which is variable based on machine used, etc., we can count the number of
// simple operations a computer needs to perform. However, we don't care too much about the number of operations, 
// but rather about the general trends. 

// f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)
// f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n^2)
// f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1)
// f(n) could be entirely different

//////// How do we simplify Big O expressions? ////////

//////// What is time and space complexity? //////////

//////// How do we evaluate the time and space complexity of different algos with notation? ////////
