////// What's an algo? //////

// A process or set of steps to accomplish a task
// It's the foundation for most programming

// 1. Understand the problem + devise a plan

// A. Can I restate problem in my own words? 
// B. What are the inputs that go into the problem? Outputs? What are the return values? 
// C. Is there enough information available to solve the problem? 
// D. How to label the important pieces of this problem? 

// 2. Explore examples + apply common problem solving patterns

// Examples help you understand the probelm and model how a solution should work 
// Start with simple examples, progressing to more complex examples, examples with empty or invalid inputs. 

// 3. Break it down
// 4. Solve/simplify 

// Simplify: find core difficulty, temporarily ignore it, write a simplified solve, then incorporate it back. 
// Usually by here, you'll have gleaned some insight into the difficulty. 

// 5. Look back and refactor 

// Refactors Qs //
// Can you check the result?
// Can you derive result differently? 
// Can it be understood at a glance? 
// Can you use the result or method for some other problem? 
// Can you improve performance of the solution? 
// Can you think of other ways to refactor? 
// How have others solved this problem?
