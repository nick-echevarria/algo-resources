//In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to have a 
//functon for merging sorted arrays into a larger, sorted 
//array. 

//The function should run in O(n + m) time and O(n+m) space 
//and should not modify the parameters passed to it. 

//********************************************************

//PSUEDOCODE

//1. Create an empty array and behin at the smallest values 
//in both arrays
//2. While i/j have not hit the end of their respective arrays:

//      a. If the value in the first array is smaller than 
//      the value in the second array, push the value in the first 
//      array into our results and move on to the next value in the
//      first array

//      b. If the value in the first array is larger than 
//      the value in the second array, push the value in the second 
//      array into our results and move on to the next value in the
//      second array

//      c. Once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining
//      values from the other array
