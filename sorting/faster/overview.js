//Quadratic sorting algos do not scale well. 
//(Worst case is O(n2), Best - if nearly sorted - is O(n) excluding selectionSort)

//For larger data sets, faster sorts like mergeSort are better.
//This family of sorting algos can improve time compelexity from O(n2) to O(n log n)

//There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity, meaning
//more efficient algos are less simpler
