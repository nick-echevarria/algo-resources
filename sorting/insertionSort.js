// Insertion sort is similar to selection and bubble 
// sort, but there are key distinctions and other 
//things it does better. 

// It works by gradually creating a larger left half
// which is always sorted.

//PSEUDOCODE

// 1. Start by picking the second element in the Array
// 2. Compare the second element with the one before it. 
// Swap if necessary.
// 3. Continue to the next element and if it is in the
// incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion
// (i.e.the left side) to place the element in its correct 
// place
// 4. Repeat until array is sorted.
