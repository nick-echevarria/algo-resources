//Can we imporve on  O(n log n)? Yes, but not by making 
//comparisons, and only in certain cases. 

//Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works only 
//on numbers and not by making direct comparisons between two elements. 
//Instead, it exploits the fact that information about the 
//size of a number is encoded in the number of digits.
