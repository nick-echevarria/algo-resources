// A linked list is a ordered data structure that stores any
// kind of data you'd like. It contains a head, a 
// tail, and a length property. 

// Linked lists consists of nodes and each node has a
// value and a pointer to another node or null. 

// Comparison With Arrays //

// Lists //
// Don't have indexes
// Connected via nodes with a next pointer
// Random access not allowed

// Arrays // 
// Indexed in order
// Insertion/deletion can be expensive
// Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
