//A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes in a
//parent/child relationship

//List are linear, trees are non-linear 

//Root: top node of tree 
//Child: a node directly connected to another node
//when moving away from root
//Parent: the converse notion of a child 
//Sibling: a group of nodes with the same parent
//Leaf: node with no children 
//Edge: the connection between nodes

//Use Cases
//HTML DOM
//Network routing 
//Abstract Syntax Tree
//AI 
//OS folders 

//********************************************************

//Binary Trees
//Each node can, at most, have two children 
//Every node to left of parent is less and vice versa
