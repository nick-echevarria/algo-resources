// Data structures are collections of values, the relationsips
// among them, and the functions or operations that can be 
// applied to the data. For example, an array is a data
// structure. 

// Different data structures excel at different things. 
// Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are
// more generally used. As result, there is no one best data 
// structure but rather there are better data structures for 
// different challenges. 

// The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely 
// you'll need to use on of these data structures. Also, you've 
// already worked with many of them. For instance, the DOM is a 
// tree. Lastly, data structures are important for interviews. 

// Note: There's a lot of content in the data structures 
// section of this course. Don't try to master it all. Rather,
// learn a section, take a break for a day or two, then move on.
